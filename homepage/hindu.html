    <h2>The Eternal Cosmos</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>According to the <strong>Rigveda</strong> and the <strong>Puranas</strong>, the universe is cyclical — born, sustained, and dissolved through the infinite dance of creation and destruction, known as <em>Srishti</em> and <em>Pralaya</em>. Time is divided into four Yugas — Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali — each marking a decline in righteousness and cosmic harmony.</p>

    <h2>Brahmanda - The Cosmic Egg</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>The ancient seers described the concept of <strong>Brahmanda</strong> — the Cosmic Egg — as the origin of all creation. Within this, countless universes exist, each governed by <strong>Karma</strong> and the eternal cycle of birth and rebirth.</p>

    <h3>The Structure of the Universe</h3>
    <p>According to the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, there are <strong>14 lokas (realms)</strong> arranged vertically:</p>

    <div class="scripture-ref">
      <span class="title">Upper Realms (Vyahritis)</span>
      <p class="verse">
        <strong>7 Higher Lokas:</strong> Satya (Brahma), Tapa, Jana, Mahar, Svar, Bhuvar, Bhur<br>
        <strong>7 Lower Lokas:</strong> Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, Patala
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> explains the structure of space and time long before modern science attempted to measure it. It describes multiple universes within universes, each with its own Brahma as creator.</p>

      <strong>— Dr. Subhash Kak, Computer Scientist & Vedic Scholar</strong>

      "It is not possible to read the Vedas, or the remarkable ideas of Indian cosmology, without feeling that these are much closer to modern physics than the early Greek or medieval European systems."  
      <strong>— Arthur Eddington, British Astrophysicist</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense, infinite number of deaths and rebirths. It's the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology."  
      <strong>— Carl Sagan, American Cosmologist</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "The most remarkable feature of Hindu cosmology is its time scale. The Puranic view of the cosmos is very close to Big Bang cosmology in recognizing a cyclic universe."
